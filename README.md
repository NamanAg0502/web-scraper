# Concurrent Web Scraper

## Overview

This project is a concurrent web scraper written in Go. It fetches URLs, parses HTML content, and stores results in a thread-safe manner. The scraper uses goroutines for concurrency, a WaitGroup for synchronization, and implements rate limiting to manage the fetch requests.

## Features

- Concurrent fetching of URLs
- HTML parsing
- Concurrent-safe result storage
- Rate limiting
- Error handling
- Logging
- User-friendly output

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up project structure

Organize the project into different packages:

- `fetcher`: Handles URL fetching
- `parser`: Contains HTML parsing logic
- `storage`: Manages concurrent-safe storage
- `rate_limiter`: Implements rate limiting
- `utils`: Utility functions like logging

### 2. Implement URL input handling

Create a function to read URLs from a file or standard input.

### 3. Create basic HTTP client

Set up an HTTP client to handle requests.

### 4. Implement concurrent fetching

Create a `fetchURL` function to fetch data from a URL. Use goroutines for each URL and a `WaitGroup` to synchronize the goroutines.

### 5. Add HTML parsing

Choose a library like `goquery` for parsing HTML. Implement the parsing logic to extract the desired information.

### 6. Implement concurrent-safe result storage

Create a thread-safe data structure using a mutex or channels to store the results. Implement a storage function to handle concurrent writes.

### 7. Add rate limiting

Implement a token bucket algorithm to control the rate of URL fetching. Apply the rate limiting logic to the `fetchURL` function.

### 8. Implement error handling

Add proper error handling throughout the code to manage and log errors.

### 9. Add logging

Implement logging using a library like `logrus` or the standard `log` package.

### 10. Create user-friendly output

Format the output in a user-friendly manner, such as JSON or CSV.

### 11. Test with various websites

Test the scraper with different websites to ensure it handles various HTML structures and contents.

### 12. Optimize performance

Analyze the performance and optimize the code for better concurrency and efficiency.

### 13. Document code and usage

Write detailed documentation on how to use the scraper, including code comments and a user guide.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concurrent-web-scraper.git
   cd concurrent-web-scraper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Running the Scraper

1. Prepare a file `urls.txt` with the list of URLs to scrape.
2. Run the scraper:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

### Configuration

- Modify `rate_limiter/rate_limiter.go` to change the rate limit settings.
- Adjust logging settings in `utils/logger.go`.

### Example

```sh
go run main.go
```
